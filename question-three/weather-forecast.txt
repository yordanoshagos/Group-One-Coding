Input:
A city name
A temperature value
A humidity value
A wind speed value

Output:
An updated data structure containing weather information for each city, where each city is associated with its temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Process:

1. Create a hashmap for the weather report of different cities.

2. For every weather report, there is the city’s name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

3. If the city is already in the hashmap,  write the new one's weather details in the hashmap.

4. Repeat step 3  for every city’s weather report.

5. Then the hashmap will show the weather for every city processed.
